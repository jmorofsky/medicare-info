# Meghan Explains Medicare - https://meghanexplainsmedicare.com

An informational website created to help potential customers learn about Medicare, and how my client Meghan can help them.

After meeting with Meghan, we decided what the site needed to contain: an enticing splash screen, reasons why you should trust Meghan with your Medicare plans, information about Medicare parts, and a contact section.

The styling needed to be clean and professional. Since most of the people looking into Medicare are older, the site also needed to accommodate an older audience's needs. This meant making text large and clearly legible, and with high contrast. The overall layout of the site was kept simple and minimalistic to help achieve this goal.

### Development

The website was created with React, though not many React principles were needed during development. The site is a single page application with no moving parts.

The majority of the development process was focused on perfecting the design and individual visual elements of the app.

Overall, I think the look and feel of the site came out great and is exactly what we were going for. The website looks clean, simplistic, and stylish. The transitions between sections add some flair without overdoing it. The backgrounds mostly consist of solid colors. Most importantly, the site looks professional while catering to the needs of an older audience.
